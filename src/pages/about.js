      <h2>My Process</h2>
      <p>
        When I first started this project, I was the most excited to get going
        on the styles and had a gameplan in mind for it. I decided I wanted to
        do this project for my sisters hair business and she gave me a color
        scheme that she wanted me to follow and I made a lot of progress with it
        quickly. Once I got a good base of what my website was going to look
        like. I turned to functionality and needed to get my tables set for the
        backend. when I began building my backend code. I began figuring out the
        tables I would need on the fly without building out an ERD first. this
        made it difficult to organize what was connected to what and as my
        relationships and tables changes it made it hard to keep track of
        everything. So I took a step back and built at my ERD to how I would
        need it. and cruised through the models and controllers from there. once
        I finished. I took the routes I would need for my application, and from
        there all I had left to do was connect them to my app, adjust some
        styles, and write this recap.

      <h2>Struggles</h2>
      <p>
        The most challenging part about this semester, was of course taking both
        frontend and backend classes at the same time. In order to get to where
        I am right now with programming, I had to really commit to this program
        and sacrifice most of my free time. Keeping myself on a strict schedule
        of Work, Lunch, Backend, Gym, Dinner, Frontend, Homework, Sleep; was
        very important if I was going to stay caught up in both classes. it was
        difficult, but has also been very rewarding and a great learning
        experience for me.

      <h2>Favorite Languages</h2>
      <p>
        I would say that styling has been the most natural for me to learn. I'd
        say it's defintitely easier to learn HTML, CSS, and SCSS when you can
        see exactly what you're code is doing on display. That has been a lot of
        fun for me and it's harder to find a rythym with languages like JS that
        require a lot of critical thinking. I would say I also really enjoyed
        SQL Alchemy, I originally had a hard time articulating basic SQL into my
        foundation's capstone. but once I got better with SQL ALchemy it just
        felt like I unlocked a shortcut that just made so much more sense to me
        on how I would build out bigger applications
